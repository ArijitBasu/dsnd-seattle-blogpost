This repository contains a Jupyter notebook containing analysis that I completed on the Kaggle/AirBnb Seattle datasets as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. It also includes the data files I used in the analysis.

## Installations 
We have used the followinng libraries as part of the projct - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [matplotlib/pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). 

## Motivation
The primary motivation for this project was to complete a component of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. I chose to explore the Seattle datasets and answer the following business/data questions:
  - How does listing availability and price change over the course of the year in Seattle?
  - Which neighbourhood has the most listings? Which neighbourhoods have the highest listing prices?
  - Which features affect the Pricing of a property the most?

## File descriptions
- seattle
  - calendar.csv, listings.csv, reviews.csv - These are the three Seattle data files used in the analysis, which include information on AirBnB listings, reviews, and calendar/availability.
- seattle_data_processing.ipynb - This is the Jupyter notebook containing my analysis.
